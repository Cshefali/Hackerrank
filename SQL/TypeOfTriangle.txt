TRIANGLES table contains 3 integer columns with value of 3 sides. Objective is to identify the type of triangle corresponding to each record.
If condition does not match for any triangle type, print "Not a triangle." corresponding to the same.
This Question is an example of Nested CASE().

Solution:
SELECT CASE
  WHEN A+B>C AND A+C>B AND B+C>A
  CASE
    WHEN A=B AND A=C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A=B OR A=C OR B=C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
   END
  ELSE 'Not A Triangle.'
 END
FROM TRIANGLES;
